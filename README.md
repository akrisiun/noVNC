## noVNC: HTML VNC Client Library and Application

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/novnc/noVNC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/novnc/noVNC)

### Description

noVNC is both a HTML VNC client JavaScript library and an application built on
top of that library. noVNC runs well in any modern browser including mobile
browsers (iOS and Android).
We have a [wiki](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/wiki/) with lots of
helpful information.
noVNC has a sister project [websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) that provides a simple such
proxy.

### News/help/contact

### Browser Requirements

noVNC uses many modern web technologies so a formal requirement list is
not available. However these are the minimum versions we are currently
aware of:

* Chrome 49, Firefox 44, Safari 10, Opera 36, IE 11, Edge 12

### Server Requirements

noVNC follows the standard VNC protocol, but unlike other VNC clients it does
require WebSockets support. Many servers include support (e.g.
[x11vnc/libvncserver](http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/),
[QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/), and
[MobileVNC](http://www.smartlab.at/mobilevnc/)), but for the others you need to
use a WebSockets to TCP socket proxy. 
noVNC has a sister project
[websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) that provides a simple such
proxy.


### Quick Start

* Use the launch script to automatically download and start websockify, which
  includes a mini-webserver and the WebSockets proxy. The `--vnc` option is
  used to specify the location of a running VNC server:

    `./utils/launch.sh --vnc localhost:5901`

* Point your browser to the cut-and-paste URL that is output by the launch
  script. Hit the Connect button, enter a password if the VNC server has one
  configured, and enjoy!


### Integration and Deployment

Please see our other documents for how to integrate noVNC in your own software,
or deploying the noVNC application in production environments:

* [Embedding](docs/EMBEDDING.md) - For the noVNC application
* [Library](docs/LIBRARY.md) - For the noVNC JavaScript library
